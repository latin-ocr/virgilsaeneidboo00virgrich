the vast power of the Roman Empire.

Many disconnected traditions linked the name of Aeneas
or of Troy with a variety of places on the Mediterranean
coasts. Dionysius of Halicarnassusl (a Greek who lived
in Rome at the time of Virgil) cites the story that Aeneas
died in Thrace, but he is also familiar with traditions which
made him die in Arcadia and Italy. His tomb, indeed, was
found in so many places that 13116 writer fears the fact may
prove a puzzle. “But let people refiect,'⁷ 116 adds, “that
this difficulty is common to many heroes, especially those
who have had remarkable fortunes and hav-e lived lives of
wandering, and let them learn that, while only one place
receives the actual body, memorials have been raised in
many places from good-will for kindness rendered, especially
if any of the hero's race have survived, or because the hero
founded the particular city, or stayed there a long time and
was a benefactor.” And in this way Dionysius accounts
for the tombs of Aeneas in Ilium, Bebrycia, Phrygia,
Pallene, Arcadia, Sicily, and “many other places ‘⁵' where,
after death, “he was honored with mounds and much
building of tombs.'⁷

Tradition also connects Aeneas closely with the worship
of Venus (or Aphodite). Thus he is said to have founded
temples in her honor at Pallene, Cythera, Zacynthos, and
Buthrotum, while at Leucas and Actium, as well as on the
river Elymus, 111 Sicily, the temples had the names of both
Aeneas and Aphrodite. There was also a town of Aeneia
in Pallene, a shrine of Aeneas in Ambracia, and an island
of Aenaria near Cumae, while near the Sicilian Eryx, where
