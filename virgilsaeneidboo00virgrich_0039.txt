INTRODUCTION xxxi

Geoffrey's work gave birth to a Frenoh poem, upon whioh
was founded Layamon⁷s Brut. The myth was generally
accepted down to the middle of the seventeenth oentury
and Milton reeords it in his history. The literature of the
Elizabethan age is filled with allusions to it.

To deal adequately with Virgil⁷s direct influenoe on our
literature would be a gigantis} task, and here we oan merely
suggest how far-reaching it has been. In the Hous of Fame
Chauoer gives an outline of the Aeneia, dwelling mainly on
the Dido episode, a story of peouliar fascination for all the
Elizabethan writers. Nash and Marlowe dramatized it, and
Shakespeare refers to it many times. Baoon calls Virgil
“the ohastest poet and royalest‚ that to the memory of man
is known.''

Most of our later poets have confessed their indebtedness
to Virgil. For Dryden he is his divine master. Cowper

counted it
“ An effort vain
To sweeten more sweet Maro's matohless strain.'’

In Wordsworth's eyes the Bay of N aples was sacred to
virgil: ’
“ That delioious Bay
Parthenope's Domain — Virgilian haunt 3
Illustrated with never dying verse,
And by the Poet's laurel-shaded tomb,

Age after age to pilgrims from all lands
Endeared.” 1

At Naples, too, Matthew Arnold can think only of the
“sweet, tender Virgil.'' William Morris gave striking evi-
dence of his fondness for the poet by translating the long
Aeneid into English verse, and so we may pass down the
