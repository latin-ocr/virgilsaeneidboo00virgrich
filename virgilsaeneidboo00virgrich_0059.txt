second syllable may be either long or short (syllaba anceps).
The following, therefore, is the scheme:

The fact that either dactyls or spondees may be used in
the verse allows the poet to group these feet with consid-
erable variety, and in this variety of grouping we see one
side of the poet⁷s technical and artistic skill. A prepon-
derance of dactyls gives to the verse a comparatively light
and rapid movement3 one of spondees,·a comparatively
heavy and slow movement, Contrast, for example, the fol-
lowing verses:

(a) fert umero gradiensque deas supereminet omnis (Ι. 501) ;

(b) iamque ascendebant collem, qui plurimus urbi (Ι. 419).
Rapid movement accords With joy, excitement, and passion,
while slow movemeut harmonizes with solemnity, sadness‚
weariness, and kindred ideas. Virgil's thought is beauti-
fully reflected in his metrical combinations, and the student
is urged to study the most important passages in the poem
from this point of view. ·

The hexameter may also be varied by means of the ccre—
surae and diaereses. A caesura is produced when a word
ends within a foot3 a diaeresis, when the end of a word
coincides with the end of a foot. The principa] caesura,
commonly called the caesura, falls in the middle of the
verse, either in the third or the fourth foot.1 Thus:

arma virumque cano, ΙΙ Troiae qui primus ab oris (I. 1) ;
inferretque deos Latio, ΙΙ genus unde Latinum (I. 6).

Τ116 caesura, again, may be either masculz’ne or feminine,
according as it falls ‘after the first syllable of the foot, or
after the first short syllable of the dactyl. The principa]
