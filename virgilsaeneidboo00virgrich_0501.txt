5. duri magno sed amore, eto: but the cruel panys when deep
love is profcmecl, and the knowledge osu-hat afrenzied woman can (Io,
lead the hear-ts of the Trojans into sadjbrebodinys. The neuter par-
ticiple notum is here used as a substantive, and its force, logically,
though not grammatioally, extends to (luri dolores, which therefore

⁷ implies the knowleclye oferuel panys. The notion involved in polluto

is that of the deseeration of something sacred. This is said from
Dido's point of view.
