421. ille: tlte monster. fame: this word has its final syllable
long, as if from the fifth instead of the third declension.

424. sepulto: buried in slumber.

425. inremeabilis: ‘renavigable never' (Rhoades); ‘irreme-
able' (Conington and Billson). This striking word, apparently

are assigned to neutral ground, the place neither of punishment,
nor of joy.

ln the first circle of his luserim, Dante places the spirits of those
who died unbuptized, before Christianity (I14fe1·m›IV.). In that
Lilnbo Virgil himself “abides with the innocent babes bitten by
the fangs of death, ere they were exenipt from human sin ” (Pun-
yatorc'o, VII. :31 ff).
