iumen iuventae purpureum, Ι. 590, with note. Wordsworth has a
close rendering of this passage in his Laodamia, and retains the
word purpureal:—-·

‘⁶ Of all that is most beauteous — iniaged there
In happier beauty : more pellucid 8116111118,
An ampler ether, a diviner air
And fields in vested with purpureal gleams;
Climes which the sun who sheds the brightest day
Earth knows, is all unworthy to survey.''

solemque suum, sua sidera: striking alliteration and chiastic
order. suam aud sua imply that their sun and stars are different
from ours.

(Paraslise Lost, H. 528 ff..)

644. pedibus plaudunt choreas: trip it in the clance. The
verse shows double allsteration, with onomatopoetic effect.

645. Threicius sacerdos: ile. Orpheus, who is a priest 01
Apollo, in ‘che garb of Apollo (lonya cum veste).

646. obloquitur numeriS, etc.: matclzes their
mensures with seven clear notes. The seren dffer-
ences of noles are the distinct notes of the scale
(according with 13116 lyre's seven strings), which ⁷
Orpheus utters in response 10 (0b-) the rhythmis
(numeris) of the dance and song.

647. eadem: zze. <lim-imina.
