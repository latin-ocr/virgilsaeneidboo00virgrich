But the epicis also an expression of the best religious
sentiment of Rome. This great empire had been built up
by men who put their trust in the gods3 nay, it was the

nature and fully recognized man’s dependence on a super-
natural, divine Power. This Power is often designated as
Fatum or Fata or Fortuna, and all beings are subject to it,
whether men or the gods of popular belief. Of the latter,
Jupiter <called omnipotens) appears at times as practically on

their viceroy, executing their will. Among the other gods
Apollo plays a conspicuous part. He may be regarded as
the spokesman or prophet of Jupiter, and just as he figures
prominently in Plato⁷s ideal state, so we find Augustus
paying him special honor in his attempt to put fresh life
into the religious ritual of Rome. This effort is reflected
in the Aeneia}

prominence to the goddess from whom, according to popu-
