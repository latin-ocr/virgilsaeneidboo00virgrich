INTRODUGTION xxi

7. Virgil⁷s education was carefully attended to. He
studied at Mantua and Cremona, then at the larger city

His e duca· of Milan (Mediolanum), and lastly at the age of

tion and seventeen he passed on to Rome. This was in
{itam-ry the year 53 Bo, one year after the death of
ralnmg.

Catullus and two years after that of Lucretius.
Virgil studied under the best masters: Greek under Par-
thenius, a poet of some note 3 rhetoric under Epidius, the
master of Antonius and Octavius3 and philosophy under
Siro, a distinguished Epicurean. ¹This last study had great
attractions for the youth, and one poem in the C'ataleptonl
voices the delight with which, giving up the rhetoricians
and grammarians, he turned to philosophy.

8. The poem just referred to is composed in a peculiar
metre2 much used by Catullus, to whom, in the sixth

Aenez'cl, Virgil paid marked homage, for the line

ἱζῗζζῖῗοζξὸ, with which Aeneas begins his address to Dido

especially in the world below,
Lucretius.
Invitus, regina, tuo de litore cessi, 3

is taken directly from an elegiae poem4 by the earlier writer.
virgil, then, studied Catullus, and thus, perhaps, secured
not a little of the precision, delicacy, and artistic finish for
which Catullus is famous. ’

But if Virgil is indebted to Catullus, much greater is his
debt to another famous poet, Lucretius. Catullus could
teach form and style, but Lucretius could widen the horizon
of his spirit. In a certain passage of the Georyz'cs,⁵ Virgil
pays a remarkable tribute to the author of the great poem

group of 14 short poems attributed to Virgil. Some, at least, of these are
