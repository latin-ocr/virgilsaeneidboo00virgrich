V.

Ohanher of the Pollio, glorying
in the blissful years again to be,
Summers of the snakeless meadow,
unlaborious earth and oarless sea3

Thou that seesb Universal VI.

Nature moved by Universal Mind3

Thou majestio in thy sadness
at the doubtful (loom of human kind3

VII.

Light among ‘che vanish'd ages3

star ‘uhab gildes'c ye‘c this phantom shore3
Golden branoh amiel the shadows,

kings and realms that] pass to rise no more;

VIII.

Now ‘chy Forum roars no longer,

fallen every purple Caesar's dome—
Tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm

sound for ever of Imperial Romef-

IX.
Now ‘che Rome of slaves bath perish'd,
ancl the Rome of freemen holds her place,

I, from out: ‘che Northern Island
sunder'd onee from all the human raoe,

I salute thee, Mantovano, X·

I ‘chat loved thee since my day began,
Wielder of the stabelies‘c measure
ever moulded. by the lips of man.
