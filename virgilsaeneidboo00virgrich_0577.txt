BOOK VI 47 9

explains obscuram, which is very emphatic by position. primo
mense does not mean the first of the month, when the moon could
not be seen, but the early mouth froin the third day on, ,when the
moon begins to be visible. For the difficulty of recognizing Dido's
shade, cf. 340.

455. dulci amore: yet some critics tell us that Aeneas did not
love Dido.

456. ergo: the inferential particle is very expressive, and im-
plies long pondering over the fact3 'tu-as a true messaye, then, that
reached me. Virgil does not tell us how Aeneas received this news.
He did learn from Mercury (IV. 564) that Dido was cerm mori,
and the sight of the· blazing pyre filled him with gloomy forebod·
ings, as he sailed away from Carthage (V. 7). The addition of
ferro, 457, may be an inference from her present appearance (re-
cens α volnere, 450).

457. exstinctam: sc. te esse. extrema secutam: lzaclst souyht
thy (loom.

458. funeris: note the emphatic position3 was it death (not

merely sorrow) I brouq'hc thee?
’ 459. per superos: by the world abore. This means here the
earth, but in ΙΙΙ. 600, the gods3 cf. acl superos, 481. Aeneas thus
swears by the heavens, the earth, and Hades. et si qua fide5‚
etc„ ancl by whatever is sacred in the gyrare.

461. iussa deum: cf. IV. 268 ff„ 345-6‚ 396.

462. senta situ: squalz'd with sowy} a quaint, alliterative phrase
(ί rusty-rough‚' Morris)‚ suggested by Homer's Ἀΐδεω δόμον εὐρώεντα,
the mouldy house of Hades (Odyssey X. 512).

463. imperiis egere suis: drot-e me reith their behests. The
expression implies a distinction between iussa and imperia, the
latter being more specific and exacting than the former.

464. discessu: sc. meo.

465. aspectu: dative3 cf. copiti subduxerat ensem, 524. ‘ne sub«
trahe: the construction is archaic and therefore poetical.

466. extremum fato, qnod te adloquor, hoc est: by fate’s
dec-ree this is the last word I may specle to thee ,· fato is a causa]
ablative. qnod: inner object, with adloquor.
