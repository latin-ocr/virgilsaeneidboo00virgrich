678. dehinc: a monosyllable, as often in older poetry. lin-
quunt: ele. Aeneas and the Sibyl. It is implied that Musaeus
now leaves them.

(This beautiful passage has always appealed strongly to great poets,
eq. Dante, Sehiller, and Wordsworth. Tennyson has it, as well as the
eleventh book of the Odyssey, in view, when in his Tiresias he dwells
upon the joys of his “ Pagan Paradise ’³ ε -

“ and these eyes will find
The men 1 knew, and watch the ehariot whirl
About the goal again, and hunters race
The shadowy lion, and the warrior-kings
In height and prowess more than human, strive
Again for glory‚ while the golden lyre
Is ever sounding in hel-oie ears
Heroie hymns‚ and everywhere the vales
wind, clouded with the grateful incense-sume ·
Of those who mix all odor to the Gods
On one far height in one far-shining fire.”

Resides the beauty of thought, note the cumulative effect of the
balanced phrases in the three opening verses, with the impressive
spondaie rhythm (637), the alliteration (locos laetos), and the simi-
larity of final syllables. In the rest of the passage, alliteration is very
marked, especially in 641. 644, 647, 648, 653„ 660, 674. Spondaie
rhythm is artistieally used to picture toil (643) or repose (652) or a
calm demeanor (666, 672). On the other hand, the dactyls of 647, 655,
670, and 675 suggest joyousness or keen expectation.)
