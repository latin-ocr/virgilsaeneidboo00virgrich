Bacchae, a famous tragedy of Euripides. In this, When Pentheus
is driven mad by Bacchus, he ‘⁶ seems to see two suns and a double
Thebes, even the city of seven gates '' (ll. 918-19). In Eumenizlwn

to which he returns in 471. ,

471. scaenis agitatus: driven over the stay& as in fihe Eumeni-

Contrast with these verses 465, in which the dactyls express intense
excitement.)
