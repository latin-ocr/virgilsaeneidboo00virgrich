suffered as well. The poet, like 'his neighbors, was dispos-
sessed of his farm and, attempting resistance, barely escaped
with his life.l But the momentary misfortune was a wonder-
ful blessing in disguise. Virgil found a friend in the noble
Asinius Pollio, administrator of the province, and secured
the patronage of two distinguished men, Cornelius Gallus
and Alfenus Varus, both of whom had been· his fellow- .
students in Rome. Through them he was introduced to
Octavius, and either recovered his farm or received in com-
pensation an estate in Campania.

10. The poems, in which Virgil records his experience
at this trying time, are the ten Ecloqzces, written at various
times after 43 Bc, and published in their

present order in 37 Rc. The two which are
mainly concerned with his expulsion from the farm are the

first and ninth, but at least three, viz. the second, third, and
fifth (and probably the seventh as well), preceded the first in
point of time, and, like it, were written in the poet’s native
district. The sixth and nint-h were composed at Siro's
villa, the remainder, viz. the fourth, eighth, and tenth,
· were written in Rome. Pollio, Gallus, and Varus are all
sung in the Ecloyues, but the first of the poems doubtless
won its place in the series because of the honor there paid
to Octavius, who before 37· B.c. had become sole ruler in
Italy.

The Ecloques are permeated with an air of tender and
romantic sentiment, of love of home and friends and country,
of the dolce far niente of Italian life, of happy ‘communion
with nature in her many phases. Their fragrant atmosphere
and rich melodiousness have commended them to the choice
spirits of many generations. Milton, Coleridge, and XVords
