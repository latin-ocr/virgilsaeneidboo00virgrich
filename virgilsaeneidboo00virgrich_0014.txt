viii PREFACE

reading of the text, in case reference books on these sub
jects are not available.

The text has been carefully prepared, but no one authority
has been uniformly followed. In the comparatively few
cases of disputed readings, the evidence of the major Vir-
gilian Mss and ancient commentators, as well as the views
of modern scholars, has been carefully weighed before a
decision has been reached.

It would be practically impossible to enumerate the many
authorities to whom an editor of Virgil is necessarily in-
debted. One advantage which we have had over previous
editors is the use of Heinze’s important work, Virqz‘ls Epz’sclee
Techch, and of Norden's brilliant edition of the Sixth Book.
To both of these we are under special obligation. To
another recent work, Glover⁷s Studies in Vz'rqz‘l, our Intro-
duction probably owes some of its color, if not of its actual
material.

To the many teachers who have shown an interest in our
work we express our deep appreciation. If the book itself
shall meet with their approval, our “labor of love,⁷’ which
has been a pleasure in itself, will have been well repaid.

Α demand for a fresh reprint gives us an opportunity to
thank the many teachers in all parts of the country who
have shown their appreciation of our work. A number of
crrors have boen rectificd. For this we are especially in-
debtcd to Miss Esther Spencer, assistant in Latin in Stan-
ford Univcrsity, and Mr. J. P. Noui-se, of the Lowell Iligh
school, San Francisco.
