The Tabula Iliaca, a small gypsum tablet, with sculptured
soenes of the sack of Troy. In the centre we see Aeneas
and his family leaving the city under the guidanee of
Hermes (Mercury). Aeneas is carrying Anchises (the
latter holding the Penates), and leads Asc-anius by the
hand, while a female figure (presumably Creusa) follows.
Lower down, to our right, the party is embarking. The
helmsman Misenus brings up the rear, but the woman is
no longer to be seen. The tablet is 111 1116 Capitoline
