618. Phlegyas: in Dante, Phlegyas plays a part similar to
Charon's, being a ferryman over the marsh of the fifth circle (I η-
ferno, Canto VIII. 17 ff..)

620. moniti: ale. by me. This motive, that of having sinners
testify to the truth, is used by Dante, who, sor example, has an
envious spirit in Purgatory proclaim the gospel of love (Pur-quecun,
Canto XIII. 36). temnere: cf. note on I. 542.

622. fixit leges pretio atque refixit: made ancl unmasle Zawsfor
α bribe. The words are suggested by the early custom of inscrib-
ing on a brass plate the laws that were enacted. It is probable
that in this passage Virgil is glancing at Marcus Antonius, the
opponent of Augustus.

623. hymenaeos: this quadrisyllable, a Greek word, is always
last in a Virgilian verse3 cf. 1. 6513 IV. 99, etc. See note on IV.

“ All dared great guilt, and reaped their daring's fruit.'’ ¹(Billson.)

625. linguae centum: Virgil has enlarged on Homer’s ten
(Iliad, II. 489); cf. note on bis patet, 578. For the form of the

626. scelerum formas: cf. note on forma, 615.

(In the description of Tartarus (548-561), note the many allitera-
tions, with the picturesque use of certain consonants‚ especially s, r, t
(cf. 548, 550, 551, 554, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561). The spondees open-
ing 552 and 557 are impressive, and the closing line of the section
(561) is, except for the fifth foci), spondaic throughout.

In the Sibyl's narrative of horrors. Virgil exhibits a wonderful
resourcefulness in linguistic effects. Alliteration, onomatopoeia, and
*figures of rhetoric are numerous. Hard and harsh consonants (t, p,
c, s, r) again abound. See 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 577, 578, 580, 583, 591,
592 f„ 602, 609, 611, 616, 627. For vowel effects‚ see especially 572,
576. For special rhythmical effects, see 574-5‚ 576, 590, 602, 614, 616-
7 628 624.

'In the catalogue of sinners and their punishments‚ Virgil avoids
monotony by taking the sinners partly from tradition (580, 582, 585.
595, 601, 617), and partly from actual life (608 ff„ 621, 623). Some-
times, too, he mentions the punishment but not the offence (as in 581,
596, 602, 616), and sometimes the offence, but not the punishment
