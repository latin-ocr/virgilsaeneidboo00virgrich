BOOK vt 511

881. equi armos: his horse’s flanlcs.

882. si qua fata aspera rumpas, tu Marcellus eris: z'fin any
way thou conldst burst the harsh bonds offate, thou skalt be Marcellus.
The conditional sentence is mixed in form, because Anchises
expresses a wish as well as a condition3 in other words, apart from
the wish, We should have rumpes or ruperis, but even as he utters
the thought, Anchises realizes its hopelessness. To ‘burst the
harsh bonds of fate ' means, of course, to escape the early death to
Which he is doomed. By illarcellus, Virgil means not merely the
spes Marcelli, the youth of great promise (see note on 875), but the
man Marcellus, the glory of the empire.

Some place a mark of exclamation after rumpas, and make tu
Marcellus eris an independent sentence3 but though this gives good
sense, it breaks up the connection in thought and substitutes dis·
jointed utterances‚ which are never found in Virgil at the climax
of a scene, however pathetic.

883. manibus date lilia plenis, etc.: bring me lilies with full
hands. Anchises imagines himself present at the funeral of
Marcellus.

It is characteristic of Dante that he represents angelic bands
as crying not merely, in the words of Scriptum, benedictus qai venis,
but also manibus date lilia plenis from Virgil (Paryatorzb, Canto
XXX. 19-21).

884. purpureos flores: cf. V. 79, and see note 011 purpureas
vestes, 221 above. spargam: a vol'itive subjunctive, expressing a
proposal, unconnected with (lale, thus differing from the syntax
of (late volnera lymphis abluam, IV. 683. H. & B. 501, 2. The
words manibus plenis belong to sparyam as much as to (late. ani-
mamque nepotis, etc. ε Zet me heap o’er my off'spriny's shade at least
these yifls. The construction is similar to that of verbs of pre-
senting with, etc. ⁸

887. aeris in campis t in the mistgs plains.

890. gerenda: sc. sint.

891. Laurentis populos: i.e. the people of Laurentum, the

‘sapital of Latinus.
892. Cf. ΠΙ. 459.
