BOOK 11 277

220. ille: emphatic asyndeton. simul . . . simul (222) :
anaphora and asyndeton3 cf. Ι. 631.

221. perfusus vittas: his fillets steeped; cf. 210. The priest’s
sacred dress is not spared.¹

223. qualis mugitus: sc. tollit‚such bellota-inys as a bull raises. It
is also possible to take marsitas as a nominative case With est under-
stood. For the sound of the line, however, the long vowels of the
accusative are an advantage.

224. incertam: ill-aimeri.

225. lapsu effugiunt: ylide away and escape, literally‚ escape with
a ylidiny motion. delubra summa: i.e. the shrines on the acropolis.

226. arcem: here used for templum, because the temple is on
the acropolis.

227. pedibus deae: ᾖε. under Minerva's statue. This must
have been set up by the Trojans when the Palladium was stolen.
Virgil's idea was perhaps suggested by statues of Minerva, which
sometimes have a serpent at the base. teguntur: hide themselves ;
middle voice.

Note that Virgil does not describe the actual death of Laocoon
and his sons. This reticence is in accord With the spirit of the
best classic art.

(This Laocoon scene has been very carefully composed. Allitera-
tive effects are especially common. Thus besides the striking lines
199, 209, 213 (see notes) we have ivi-provida peccora 200, sorte
sacerdos 201, Tenedo tranquilla 203, pelasso pariter 205, sanquineae
superant 207, suffecti sanquine 210, lambebant linquis 211, miseros
morsu 215, capite cervicibus 219. Note, too, the expressive assonance
in horresco referens 204, clamores horrendos 222, and incertam exous-
εῖτ cervice securim 224.

The spondaic rhythm lends a solemn tone to the act of sacrifice
(202) and has an onomatopoetic effect in 223, while the dactylic line
at the close (227) accords with the idea of easy motion.)

Lines 228—249.
ΤΗΕ TROJANS DRAW THE HORsE INTo THE CITY.

228. novus: strange. cunctis: ofall; dative of reference.
229. expendisse: paid the penalty of. In prose, more fully
sceleris poenas expendisse. merentem : in emphatic position.
