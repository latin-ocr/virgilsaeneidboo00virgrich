Thus we see that when Virgil undertook his epic, he had
to work into some sort of harinony a vast number of miscel-
laneous stories about Troy, the Mediterranean towns, Italy,
and Rome, and the easiest way to join these together was
’ to take as the centre of interest Aeneas, the reputed ancestor
of the imperial family. It is interesting to learn that the
head of Venus appears on coins of the J ulii in the middle
of the second century Bc, and that Julius Caesar, in the
speech delivered at the funeral of his aunt, the widow of
Marius, claimed descent from Iulus, the son of Aeneas. In
Rome, too, there were certain other families which claimed
a Trojan descent, and Virgil has given some of these the
recognition they doubtless craved.

In dealing with what we may call the Odyssey of his
work, Virgil has endeavored——and with great success—-
to include as many of these disconnected traditions as could
be embraced in a rational and connected account. Hence
the Third Book, which, in view of its subject, was probably
one of the most difficult to write, and which, therefore,
Virgil seems to have reserved to a late hour for composition.
Hence, too, certain inconsistencies between the Third Book
and the rest of the narrative, which had already been framed
without reference to the plan or details of this book. Such
inconsistencies Virgil would doubtless have rectified, had he
lived long enough to revise his work.
