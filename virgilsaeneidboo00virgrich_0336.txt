(Lines 441 and 442 afford a good illustration of alternation of
rhythm, and an impressive tone is imparted to the account of the
temple by the rhytlnn of the opening line 446. The dactyls of 463 are
expressive of good cheer (solve metus). The slow line 471 tells a tale

the pathetic fate of Troilus is still further emphasized by the allitera-
tive phrase cervixque comaeque, with its polysyndeton, as well as by
the slow spondees of 478. Alliteration is common·

The pictures described are intended merely as 'specimens, and are
not systematically arranged in pairs. We have, it is true, a Trojan
