BOOK VI 457

(In 90 and 100, note the use of impressive words, consisting wholly
of long syllables (horrendas, (ιυιῖ)(ις,]63; obscuris involvens). the two
successive verses having the hephtheinimeral caesura, an unusual fea-
ture. In marked contrast comes the accelerated rhythm ot' the follow-
ing words (ea frena furenti concutit, etc.) emphasized by alliteration
and assonance. We have an artistic contrast of rhythm in loo-107,
and in 121-122. The rhythm of ilo-114 is also carefully adapted to
the thought.)

Lines 124-155.
Tm: CONDITIONS IMPOSED oN AENEAS.

124. aras : the plural 111 the singular sense, due perhaps to anal-
ogy with altaria.

126. facilis descensus Averno: easy is the descent to Avernus.
Avernus is here used for the whole lower world; Averno is the
dative (= ad or in A vernum) used exceptionally with a verbal noun.
These words have become proverbial. Thus Thackeray’s heading
of a chapter 111 the Viryiniccns (Vol. Ι. 611. 20) is “Facilis Descen-
sus ''; cf. his remark in chz'ty Fccir (ch. 65) ε “Little boys at
school are taught in their earliest Latin book that the path of
Avernus 1 is very easy of descent.”

129. hoc opu5, hio labor: this is tlte nesle, this the toil. aequus:
kindly.

130. erexit ad aethera: has uplifted to heaven; tle. has made
illustrious. Cf. the proverbial sic itur acl astru, which comes from

Virgil (Aeneid IX. 641).

“ 131. potuere: chwe been able (to do this); the verb is an em-
phatic repetition of Aeneas’s potuit (119). media omnia: all the
mid space ; i.e. between the upper and the lower worlds.

13²· Cocytus: for the rivers of the underworld‚ with the mean-
ings of their names, cf. Milton:

“ Abhorred Styri, the flood of deadly hate3
Sad Acheron of sori‘ow, black and deep3
Cocytus, named of lamentation loud

1 Thackeray may have been familiar with Averni, not Averno. There is
authority for both readings. “
