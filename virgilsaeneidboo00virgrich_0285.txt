The four following lines are sometimes prefixed to the Aeneid .·

Ille 690, qui quondam yrace'li modulatus avena

ut quamvis avido parerent arca colono,

qratum opus agricolis .- at nunc horrentia *Martis

On these lines, see Tntrod. ξ 16. They are imitated by Milton

modulatus: sc. sum, tuned my sorry. The line refers to the
Ecloyues.

opus: accusative in apposition with the sentence. A. 397, f ;
G. 3243 H. δι Β. 395. ”
