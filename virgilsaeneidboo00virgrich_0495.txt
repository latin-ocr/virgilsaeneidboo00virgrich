(The style of this famous passage is unusually vigorous. Note es-
pecially the rapid fire of questions in 595 and 600 ff.; the frequent
alliterations (as in 589, 594, 598, 603, 604, 605); the telling apostro-
phe of an unknown avenger in 6253 the oracular, epigrammatic tone
(as in 628, 629) ; and the final hypermetric syllable (629), suggesting
an overflow of emotional excitement.

The artistic variation of the rhythm, harinonizing throughout With
the thought, is well worthy of close study, especially in the portions
587-594 and 607-629. Note the use of dactyls, expressive of energetic
action, in 588, 589, 593, 594 ; in alternation with spondees, in 602, 604,
611; of impassioned utterance, in 620, 624, 626, 628. On the mlier
hand, spondees emphasize Dido's sels-accusation in 596; her sarcasm,
in 598 ; her reflective tone, in 603 ; her solemn appeal to the· gods, in
607, 608, 610, 612; her terrible curse, in 613, 614, 615, 616-619 (with
initial dactyls), 627, 629 (initial dactyl). Emphatic diaeresis after the
first foot is common; cf. 595, 601, 618, 621, 622, 624, 629.)
