39. studia in contraria: into opposz‘nq parties.

(With Virgil's story of the wooden horse should be compared the
song of Demodocus in the Oclyssey, VIII. 499 ff. In Homer, the discus-
sion among the Trojans takes place after the horse has been dragged
up to the citadel ; Virgil more wisely represents it as occurring while
the horse is still outside the city walls.

Note the simple, concise, and vivid style of the narrative. Vividness
is increased by the persona] tone. Thus the speaker identifies himself
with the citizens (of. nos, 25), 1116 various iemarks of the 960916 are
quote-d (29, 30), and individual Trojans aie named (32, 35). Alliteia-
tion is carefully employed. See 23, 26, 27, 28, 30 (11016 1116 many c
sounds), 32, 34, 38, 39.

In 29 and 30 the diaereses (after manus and locus) and the anaphora
(hic . . -. hic . . . hic . . . hic) strongly emphasize the exciteinent
of ’1116 960916.

Note the rhythm of 24, 25, and 26. The spondaic rhythm of 24 sug-
gests the terrible snare thus laid for the Trojanss The dactylic tone
of 25 harmonizes with the joy of the besieged, but the return to the
spondaic tone in 26 111191165 that the speaker is only too well aware
that the joy is shortly to be turned into grief.)
