XXX INTRODUGTION

the passages quoted from them by the grammarians alone,

to reconstruct practically the whole of the Ecloyuas, the ³

Georqioe, and the Aenez‘d. . . . The 'authority of Virgil was
supreme, and his poetry was, so to speak, the Bible of the
ancients; it was the first of all scholastic books, and was
always in everybody⁷s hands.⁷⁷ From the time of Hadrian 1
on, the so-called “lots of Virgil⁷’ were consulted by the
superstitious, even as the faithful in like manner had re-
course to the sacred Scriptures. In the sixth century
people still crowded Trajan's Forum to hear the Aeneid
recited, and a churchman like Jerome, on hearing os the fall
of Rome when stormed by Alaric the Goth, gives utterance
to his grief in words taken partly from the Aeneicl, and
partly froin the Psalms. Many Christian poems on Biblical
themes were but centos made up of lines from Virgil⁷s works.

21. In the Middle Ages Virgil was known among the
people as a magician and a saint, and on the threshold of
modern literature he is Dante's guide to lead him
into Paradise. And if Virgil had no other claim
to distinction, this fact, that he is the acknowl-
edged “ master and author '² of Dante,² and the only source
of his “noble style,⁷' at a time when Greek had not yet come
to its hour of resurrection, would surely be enough to win
for him the reverence and affection of all.

22. On English literature Virgil has had an enormous in-
fluence in both a direct and an indirect way. In Celtic tales
virgil²s the voyage of Aeneas gave· birth to the voyage
influence on of Brutus, who founds in Albion a new Troy or
English lit· London. In the twelftlr century Geoffrey of
eratum Monniouth makes much of this story in his
history, and after> him it is found in many forms.
