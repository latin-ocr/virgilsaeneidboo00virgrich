lii INTRODUGTION

caesura in a Virgilian line is usually masculine3 the femi
nine, however, is occasionally employed, With a lighter
effect. Thus:-

dis geniti potuere. Η Tenent media omnia silvae (VI. 131).

Diaereses are much more sparingly used than caesurae,
and often serve to emphasize special turns of thought.

Thus:

volvitur in caput ; Η ast illam ter fluctus ibidem (1. 116).

A diaeresis after the fourth foot is called a bucolic diaeresis,‘
or (less correctly) a bucolic caesura, ay. .·

insidat quantus miserae deus. Η At memor ille (Ι. 719).

Besides the principles of verse construction already indi-
cated, Virgil makes liberal use of other means to secure
harmony of sound and sense. Thus the very words used
may imitate sound, as in:

exoritur clamorque virum clangorque tubarum (ΙΙ. 313).

This is called onomatopoeia. For other examples, see I.
873 Π. 7703 IV. 463.

More frequent than distinct onomatopoeia is assonance,
ie the recurrence of similar sounds. Thus, curce recursat
(Ι. 662), horresco referens (II. 204), clamores horrendos (Π,

22 .

Still more common is alliteration. This metrical orna-
ment, inlrerited from the earlier literature, is artistically
used by virgil to aid in effectiveness of expression. The
alliteration in a verse may be single, double, or even triple3
and where there is more than one instance, we may have a

variety of order, eff. «abb, (ebba, <damst
But there are other ways in which the verse of the Aeneid

¹ 1 a aud b represent the repeated letters.
