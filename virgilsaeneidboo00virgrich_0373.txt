ton, and chiasmus (anni decem . . . mille carinae). These last two
lines are strikingly siinple, yet contain a world of meaning.

(In the above passage, note that the diaeresis in 163 coincides with
the break in the euemies⁷ relations with Pallas. The account of the
sacrilege opens with a line expressive of horror, in spondaio rhythm
(165), which passes into the dactylic (167), when the hasty act of
pollution is described. Another dactylic line (181) suggests arapid
journey, and the early, return of the Greeks.)

Lines 199-227,
LAocoo'N’s TERRIBLE F'ATE.

“ This prodigy is not merely ominans, but typicat, of the destruction
about to come upon Troy. The twin serpents prefigure the Grecian
armament, which, like them, comes from Tenedos ; like them, crosses
the tranquil deep; like them, lands; and, going up straight to the
city, slaughters the surprised and unresisting Trojans (prefigured by
Laocoon‘s sons), and overturns the religion and drives out the gods
(prefigured by the priest Laocoon).'' — HENRY.

199. aliud: another (portent). maius miseris multo: the allit-
eration emphasizes the effect of the statement. miseris is to be
taken with nobis understood.

200. obicitur: on the prosody of this word, see A. 603, f. N.
33 B. 362, 53 G. 703, ⁶2, N.; H. 688, ‘23 H. & B. 30. magis: the nat-
ural order would be multo mayz's trememlwn. improvida: blind or
heedless.

201. ductus sorte: drawn (i.e. clzosen) by lot. Hence his ap-
pointment had met with the approval of the gods. Neptuno:
dative of reference. According to tradition, Laocoon was a priest
’ of Apollo, but this position is' given by virgil to Panthus3 see 319.

202. sollemnis mactabat ad aras: the regular sacrifices to
Neptune, whose shrine would naturally be near the seashore, had
doubtless been neglected during the war. Laocoon therefore takes
the earliest opportunity to offer the rites due the god. The irnper-
fect mactabat indicates that he set about his task even while Sinon
was telling his story. It is a plausible view that he wished to sup·
plicate Neptune to desti-oy the Greek fleet.
