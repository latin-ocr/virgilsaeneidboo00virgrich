(In this Charon scene, the style and diction, in keeping with the
theme, are less dignified than usual. The boatman is pereinptory and
abrupt‚ and the expressionsfare qnid venias and istinc, 389, are froin
the language of daily life. Similar is the use of absiste moveri in the
Sibyl’s reply. Note too the irony of 392 and 400-2, the use of nulla,
405 ; of deturbat, 412 ; and the somewhat humorous tone of 413-4.

It will be interesting to study the rhythm of 386, 392, 401, 408-9‚
413-4‚ and 416.) .
