266 · NOTES

position of vera, viz. at the end of the sentence and the beginning
of a line. me: sc. esse. Argolica: Graeca. Virgil skilfully
represents Sinon as first stating what is undoubtedly true: Thus
he is‘likely to win credence for the rest of his story.

79. hoc primum: sc. fateor. Sinonem: note the rhetorical
effect of using the name instead of me. The prisoner thus
strengthens his case by giving the name a sort of fictitious value.
Others may be mendacious, but certainly not Sinon. See note on
Iunonis, Ι. 48. Indirectly, too, the Tro J’ans learn who their prisoner is.

80. improba: w(ml‹mly; cf. verce, 78.

81. fando: by report,· cf. 6. aliquod si . . . nomen: literally‚
{f any name, etc„ ie. ‘ef the name llas at all reached your ears,· cf.
Anthea si quem, Ι. 181. Sinon cleverly assumes-a doubtful tone,
though he knows well that the story of Palamedes would be familiar
to the Trojans.

82. Palamedis: Palamedes, of Euboea, who was descended
from Belus, king of Egypt, had incurred the enmity of Ulysses by
exposing his pretence of madness and compelling him to take part
in the Trojau war. The story is not found in Homer. incluta
fama gloria: leis renown spread abram! ltssfitme.

83. falsa sub proditione: under false infin-uzalim. This was
furnished by a forged letter, lun-porting to come from Priam,
which Ulysses concealed in the tent of Palamedes.

84. insontem infando indicio z note the emphatic repetition of
the prefix im, and the double elision. Thus Sinon drives home his
statement with affected horror. infando indicio: on leideous
tes-limones. quia bella vetabat: Sinon iuvenis this reason so as
to wiu the favor of the Trojans for Palamedes and indirectly.f0r
himself.

85. nunc: note the asyndeton, (hut) now. cassum lumine:
archaic expression.

86. illi me, om: this is the apodosis to the si (sl) clause3 illi is
a dative of reference. Sinon is seut as a dependent 011 Pala-
medes, et Ξ et quidem.

87. pauper in arma pater, etc.: note the details artfully given
