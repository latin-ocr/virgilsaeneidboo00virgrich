601. non tibi,etc.: know that ic z's not the hateclface oftlze Lacom‘an
woman, dauylzter of Tyndareus — it z‘s not Paris that is lo blame ,· tibi
is an ethical dative. With facies, understand culpata est. Some
editors prefer to makefitcies and Paris, like inclementia, subjects of
evertit (603); but brief, pointed statemeuts are more forcible here,
and Virgil has in mind a famous passage in Homer (Iliad III. 164),
where Priam says to Helen: ⁴‘ Thou, I ween, art not to blame3
’tis the gods that are to blame, who brought on us the woful war
of the Achaeans.''

602. culpatus Paris: sc. est. Paris has'not been mentioned in
the lines preceding, but he is naturally associated in thought with
Helen. The two have the force of a plural. It is no human
agents you must accuse. It is the gods themselves who are re-
sponsible for Troy's downfall. divum inclementia divum: note

fate is hopeleSS, do not give up your efforts to escape with your
family.

609. mixto pulvere: an ablative absolute. Translate, minylezl
with (lust, Le. from the falling buildings.
