BOOK IV 367

165. speluncam, etc.: the verba] repetition (from 124) calls
attention to the fulfillnent of Juno's plau.

166. prima Tellus : primal Earth,· so called, as the oldest of the
gods. pronuba Iuno: mzplz'al Juno. The pronuba was properly
the matron who attended the bride.

167. dant signum: i.e. for the marriage ceremonies to begin.
conscius Aether conubiis: Hem-en, witness to the bridal. As
Earth was the mother, so Heaven (Aether) was the father of all
life. This is a common conception in ancient poetry and phi-
losophy, even the Chinese.

169. primusque malorum causa: thatfirst day was llze cause
of evils. The effect of the repetition of primus is the implied
repetition of ille (lies as well3 primus does not belong, either
logically or grammatically, to causa.

170. specie: appearances. fama: cf. 91 and note. Dido is

172. coniugium vocat: though there is no real marriage be-

(ivqnes) are the marriage torches (ef. taedae, 18) ; J uno is the pronuba
of the bride and the eries of mountain Nymphs become the wed-
ding-song. Dido, fully determined as she was on winning Aeneas
(the poet represents her as controlled by Venus and Juno), may
well have been blind to the truth and convinced that this was a
marriage indeed. She, then, has found Nature in sympathy with
her3 yet the poet, by his descriptive art, really suggests to us, and
at last asserts, the reverse: ille dies primus leti, etc.

Milton had this passage in mind, when he describes the effect of
Eve’s plucking and eat-in g the forbidden fruit:

“ Earth felt the wound and Nature from her seat,
· Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe
That all was lost.'' (Pam-adise Losa, IX. 782 ff. 3 cf. IX. 1000 ff.)

(The opening verse, with its descriptive alliteration, plays a rOle
similar to that in Ι. 124. It is followed by lines (161-164) in which
