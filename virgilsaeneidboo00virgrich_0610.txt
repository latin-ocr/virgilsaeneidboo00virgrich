(The dirge of Marcellus—the most pathetic scene in Roman litera-
ture —furnishes a fitting close to this noble book. For an interesting
incident associated with it, see Introd. 513. As here we have the
death of a nation·s idol, so the preceding books close respectively
with the death of (ΙΙ) Creusa, (ΙΙΙ) Anchises, (IV) Dido, (V) Pali-
nurus.

This passage, like the preceding, abounds in alliterative effects: 69.
856, 857, 858, 859, 865, 861), 872, 876, 877, 878, 887, 892.

Apostrophe (871, 873, 882), personification (ille campus naec, 872),
and exclamation (865, 872-3, 878) are most effectively employed, and
the representation of Anchises as a moui-ner, particularly in the funeral
obsequies (883-5), is a strikingly beautiful device.

The spondaic rhythm of 860 indicates the sorrowful tone of the nar-
rative following, and the sadness is strongly emphasized by the same
rhytlfnn in two successive verses (868, 869), as well as in 877. It is
sti l elt in 888.)

- Lines 893—901.
AENEAS AND THE SIBYL RETURN 'ro THE UPPER WonLD.

893. Somni portae: Virgil’s gates of sleep correspond to
Homer’s gates of dreams (Odyssey, XIX. 562 ff). fertur cornea:
is said to be of horn.

895. candenti perfecta nitens elephanto: gyleaming] with the
sheen ospolished z'z·01·y; literally‚ made yleame'ngy, etc.

896. falsa insomnia:¹ false visions, zze. of the shades, not the
shades themselves. mittunt: zle. through the ivory gate.

897. his: with (lictis.

898. portaque emittit eburna: Virgil probably intends here
merely to give a note of time. It was a popular idea that false
dreams carne before, and true dreains after, midnight. Aeneas
entered Hades at dawn (255), was half way at noon (535), and
makes his exit before inidnight.

900. recto litore : straiyht alonq the shore ‚· ablative of the route3
see note on ΙΙ. 266.

901. -- 111. 277.

( These concluding verses are of little importance in themselves, but
give a parting scene corresponding to the landing described at the
opening of the book. They also serve the artistic purpose of furnish-
ing a quiet clos(- afm- an intensely emotional passage. Τ116 tone of

sadnvss, inherited f1·‹›111 the previous paragraph, is seen in the rhythm
of 896 and 900.)
