honored ritual of their celebrations. It is seen, also, in
his intense patriotism3 still further in his devotion to his
father, who became blind3 in the story of his grief over the
loss of a brother Flaccus3 and in the fact that he provided
handsomely by will for his half-brother, Valerius Proculus.

In one of his odes,¹ Horace testifies to the pious and
affectionate character of Virgil, and the striking, almost
passionate, phrase which he elsewhere applies to him, animae
dimidium meae, ‘half of my soul,⁷ illustrates Virgil's power
of inspiring affection in others.2

It is worth while dwelling on these features of Virgil's
character, because they are all richly exemplified in his
work3 and in everything that Virgil wrote we can see, not
a merely objective narrative, but the poet's personality and
attitude toward life.

6. One of the ancient lives3 of Virgil tells 115 that the
poet was of large fralne, dark complexion, awkward in
His personal appearance, and weak in health. He suffered
appearance from dyspepsia⁴ and perhaps on this account
and habits. was absteinious iu eating and drinking. We
have already noted his shyness. 'Far from courting public·
ity, he would avoid the throngs that followed and pointed
him out by retii-ing into the nearest house. Horace describes
his three friends, virgil, Plotius, and Varius, as “the whit-
est souls ever borne by earth,''⁵ a beautiful testimony, not
only to Virgil's spotless character, but also to the purity of
his social and intellectual circle.
