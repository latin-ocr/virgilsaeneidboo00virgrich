attendant spirit which accompanies a man through life, and on his
return to the other world, punishes him until he is purged of
guilt. Thus the spirit is the agent for administering the punish-
ment described in the three verses preceding.

For the thought of this and succeeding verses, we may compare
Plato: “Now it is said that the genius who has had charge of
each man in his life, forthwith leads him after death to a place
where the dead must assemble and be judged, and then go to
Hades with the guide who has been appointed to take them
thither. And when they have received their deserts there, and
remained for the time appointed, another guide brings them back
again after many long cycles of: time.’' (Plzcceclo, ch. LVII.) ex—

there a separation takes place. A few (Anchises being one of
these) remain for ever there, regaining in time their original pur-
ity; but most of the souls must drink of the water of oblivion and
then return to new bodies (cf. 71:3-5).

745. donec longa dies, eto: till lapse (qs-time, when {he ayes’

purgation in Elysium.

749. deus: tle. Mercury.
