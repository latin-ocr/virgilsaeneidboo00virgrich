recting and reducing them to the smallest compass,¹ the
poet humorously comparing himself to a she-bear “ licking
her cub into shape.⁷⁷

It has been estimated that the length of time, seven years,
given to the θεωρίας would mean an average of less than
one line daily. No wonder that the poem reveals such ex-
quisite finish in details, and that the Aeneicl, awork between
four and five times as long and left unrevised by its author,
should in this respect suffer by comparison. As to the
later poem, we are told2 that Virgil “first drafted the
Aeneid in prose, and having arranged it in twelve books, pro-
ceeded to compose it bit by bit, just as 13116 fancy took him,
without attacking subjects 111 dne order. And that noth-
ing might stay his inspiration, 116 allowed some passages to
remain imperfect, while others he bolstered up, as it were,
With mediocre lines, which he jestingly decl-ared were in-
serted as props to support the structure, until the solid
columns arrived.⁷' During the composition, Virgil on cer-
tain occasions read his work to others, though not often,
generally confining himself to passages about which he was
111 doubt, that he might have the benefit of his hearers'

judgment. It is easy to see from this statement how it was .

that V irgil's closest literary friends, Varius and Tucca,—
both of them critics whose approval Horace promlly elanus,
and one of them, Varius, himself a tragic and epic poet of
distinction,—were, in all probability, thoroughly familiar

le. Tennyson:
“ Old μοι-13 soster'd under friondlier skies,
Old virgil, who would write ten lines, they say,
At dawn, and lavis-11 all the golden day
To make them weallhicr in his rcadcrs' eyes.”
