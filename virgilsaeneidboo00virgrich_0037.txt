These personal details'should not be overlooked when we
form our estimate of Virgil's Aenez'sl, one of the most am-

yet the offspring of a shy, diffident spirit, conscious of

Ἱ11011101, Juvenal, Tacitus, Seneca, and the rest,
were all nurtured on Virgil. Martial ancl Silius
kept his birthday sacred. He was the main subject of
study in the schools of rhetoric throughout the Empire, and
Comparetti¹ assui-es us that “the use which the granima-
