find in this scene. Thus insolid- Dido, 456 z IV. =·›0‹3; int-icus cuo (le

447, 450, 4:31, 4232, 453, 456, 460, 404, 474. The, broken rhythm of
466, with its double diaeresis and nlonosyllabic ending, is well suited

10 the pathos of 1115 thought. The artistic effect is often height-
ened by alliteration.)
