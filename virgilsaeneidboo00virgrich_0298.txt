without reproducing with precision.

(This passage has been carefully elaborated. There are numerous
alliterations (81, 82, 83, 86); the sharp diaeresis in 82 coincides with
the violent act of Aeolus ; the leading verbs in the description of the
storm are placed with strong effect at the beginning οἱ the. line (84, 87,
88, 90); an abundance of connectives (polysyndeton) is expressive of
the confusion of tine elements (85, 87. 88); the numerous syllables with
the r sonnd echo tlie din (87; cf. 83, 8ῦ), and the anaphora (99 and
100) of ubi . . . ubi. . . ubi is very rhetorical. Note the picturesque
rliythm, especially of 80· and 92.)
