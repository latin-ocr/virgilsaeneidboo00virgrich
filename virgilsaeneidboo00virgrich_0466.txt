368 NOTEs

the general dactylic movement depicts the hurry and scurry of the
hunters, as well as the onrush of the torrents. 'l‘hen comes the sober
spondaic rhythm of the repeated verse (165 z 124). This, however,
is not followed, as before, by a series of rapid dactyls, but, in keeping
with the gravity of the occurrence, the prevailing rhythm is spondaic.
Only where Dido's recklessness is described have we frequent dactyls,
viz. in 170. So, 172 opens with two dactyls (conz'uffl’um vocat), but,
the diaeresis following them is oniinous, and the succeeding spondees
(hoc praetexit) bring us back to the tone of solemnity.)
