230 NOTES

spondees following express intensity of gaze. In 394, descriptive οἱ
the eagle's swoop, dactyls prevail‚ but in :395 the tone of 393 is re
sumed. The alliteration in 398 (coetu cinaeere . . . cantus) and 399
(puppesque cuae pubesque tuorum, i.e. abab) is expressive of joy,
which is further emphasized by the assonance (similarity of sound) of
puppes and pubes, and by the redundance of connectives (-que . . .
que), sometimes called polysyndeton. The repetition in the last line
of perqe modo from 389 has the effect of a restam, and rounds off the
paragraph.)
