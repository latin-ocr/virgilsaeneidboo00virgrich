<Note the impressive spondees in 305, and contrast the rhythm in
the two similes (309-311). In the first, spondees prevail ; in the sec-
ond. the initial spondee (311) is followed by dactyls expressive of the
fiuttering movements of birds. Sober spondees are again employed
in 313, where they accord with the idea of stabant, and a similar verse
(330), closing the Sibyl's speech, is suggestive of an end attained.)
