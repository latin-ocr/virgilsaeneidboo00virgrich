chio cry, biennial revels e'nspz‘re her, and at m'yht Cithaeron summoves
wille its din. Every other year a Bacchis: festival was celebrated at
Thebes. The votat-ieS, calling upon the god (Εὖοῖ Βάκχε, Io
Bacche), roamed'in a state of frenzy over Mount Cithaeron.

304. compellat ultro: of. II. 372.

305. dissimulare etiam sperasti, perfide, ebo: to cloak, too, so
foul α wy·ony,false one l—lzast thou hoped for that? Note the great
emphasis on dissimulare, which is governed by posse ,· etiam, tle. to
hide as well as commit it. Aeneas’s supposed deception is 'whan
mainly raukles in Dido’s mind. Hence she calls him petfide.
Aeneas, however, did not intend to slip away secretly (of. 293,
337).

306. tacitus decedere: a case of abtraobion for te tacitum
decedere.

307. dextera: pledge.

308. mo'ritura Dido: the use of her name, instead of eyo, is
strikingly effective. She, the great queen, is brought: low; cf. the
use of Iunonis, I. 48. This early announcement of her intention

· (moritura) to kill herself, indicates how uneonditionally she has

surrendered herself to her love for him.

309. hiberno sidere: in the winter season. moliris: labor at.

311. quid‘? si: why, ²f· The argument is this: you would not
think of returning 'co a secure home at such a time. How much
less reason can you have for going to a foreign and unbried land?
It must be from me that you are fleeing. .

314. per ego has, eto: per governs lacrimas ,· te is governed by
oro (319). The order here followed is common in adjurations.

315. aliud nihil: nothing] else. Dido has staked her all on
Aeneas.

316. per conubia nostra, per inceptos hymenaeos: by our
marriaye, by the wedlock (thus) bessum. The second phrase correots
the first. There has been no formal marriage, though Dido has
looked forward to one. N obe that the verse ends with a word of
four syllables3 this Virgil allows in the case of Greek words,
like hymenaeus and cyparissus (cf. Ι. 651; ΠΙ. 328; III. 6803 IV.
99).
