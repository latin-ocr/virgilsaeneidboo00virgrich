312 NOTES

788. magna deum genetrix: Cybele, often called the Illayna
Ᾱῐαίθν. detinet : the poet invests Creusa's disappearance with an
air of mystery, but she secures immmtality, some higher form of
life in the service of the goddess.

206 ff.‚ where Odysseus tries to embrace the shade of his mother.
circum: adverbial. The expression is a variation of circumdare

793· comprensa = comprehensa.

(The dactylis: rhythm of 732 echoes the tramp of marching men, in
733 and 755 it voices the mental excitement, and in 791 it, accords with
the rapidity described.

Verses of spondaic rhythm are 762, expressive of vigilant care ; 775,
of calm following terror 3 783, of solemn assurance, 787, of conscious
dignity.

Note the effect of the pause and diaeresis in 739 after substitit (the
sudden halt), in 743 after venimus (the goal at last), and in 744 after
defuit (the sense of loss), as well as of the hypermetrio syllable in 745
(overfiow of emotion). The assonance of 734 is expressive of terror.
There is fine ononiatopoetic effect in 770, While 794, with its double
alliteration and soft liquid sounds, is one of Virgil’s :nost musical lines.

Other cases of alliteration are 730, 731, 742, 747, 754, 1755, 757, 759,
766, 771, 779, 790, 791.)
