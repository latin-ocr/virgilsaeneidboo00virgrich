BOOK vr 499

(In this didactic passage, there are many instances of archaic or
quaint diction used by Virgil to give a poetic coloring to what might
easily have become prosaic. Distinet archaisms are ollis (730), modis
miris (738), aurai (747). Other quaint expressions are campos
liquentis (724), (slohum lunae (725), volantum: avium (728), ‘mar-
moreo aequore (729), inolescere (738) rotam volvere (748), and the
pleonasm rursus reverti (752).

One of the most alliterative verses in Virgil is 727; cf. also 725, 728,
729, 732, 736, 737, and 742.)
