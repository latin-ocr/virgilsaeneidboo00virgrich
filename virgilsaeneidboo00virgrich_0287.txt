BOOK 1 189

4. superum: gen. plu„ -um being an earlier form of vrum.
Poetry delights in archaisms. The phrase vi superum is very
emphatic. The power which caused so much trouble to Aeneas
was no vis humana, but a vis divina. saevae memorem Iunonis
ob iram: note the artistic arrangement, by which both adjectives
precede both substantives.

5. multa quoque et bello passus: much too having suffered
in war also. These words find their best commentary in the
second half of the poem, which tells the story of Aeneas's war-
fare on Italian soil. dum conderet urbem: ere he might found
his city. The dum clause expresses the object kept in view through-
out. A. 5533 B. 310, 13 G. 5723 H. 603, II, ‘23 H. ἃ Β. 507, 5.

6. deos: i.e. the Penates, the gods of the Trojan state, whose·
images Aeneas carried away from Troy. Lati—o: dative with a

verb of motion. A. 428, h3 B. 1933 G. 3583 H. 419, 43 H. δι B. ἡ

375. From this word a locative expression is to be supplied with
conderet, for the urbs is to be in Latio. unde z e quo, and referring
back to virum, the main subject of thought throughout the para-
graph. In Aeneas, of course, are embraced his followers. Lati-
num: a Latin race existed in Italy before Aeneas, but he gave the
name Latini to the united Trojans and Latins. So in XII. 837,
Jupiter assures Juno faciamque omnis uno ore Latinos, I will make
them all Latius of one speech. ,

7. Albani patres: many of the great senatorial families of
Rome, including the Julii, claimed descent from the families of
Alba Longa. Romae: note the reference to the three stages of
growth -— Lavinium founded by Aeneas, Alba Longa by Ascanius,
Rome by Romulus and Remus.

(In the opening verse “ our author seems to sound a charge, and be-
gins—like the clangor of a trumpet—scarce a word without an r,
and the vowels‚ for the greater part, sonorous '’ (Dryden). Note the
alliterative effects in Laviniaque venit litora, and in superum saevae ,·
the prominence of the c sound in line 3, emphasizing the thought ; the
rhetorical repetition, called anaphora, in mustum . . . multa ,· and the
abundance of connectives in lines 3 and 5, suggesting an abundance
of material for poetic treatment. Especially effective is the last verse
with its rich vowel sounds.)
