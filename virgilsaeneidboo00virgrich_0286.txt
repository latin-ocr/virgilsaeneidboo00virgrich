ΤΗΕ POET’s THEME.

The poem is an epic of war (arma), and its hero (virum) is a
Trojan, who, working ont the destiny (fato) of his people, not-
withstanding terrible trials due to unfriendly gods (vi superum),
reached Italy (Italiam), andffiounded the Roman race (Romae).
The emphasis of this stately exordium culminates in Romae, but
note the several important ideas which it suggests for an under-
standing of the poem as a whole.

1. arma virumque: probably no words are more commonly
cited from the Latin classics than these. To take two examples,
they supply a title for Thackeray's Viryinz’ans, Vol. Π. 011. 14, and for
a play of Bernard Shaw's. virum: note that the hero is not men-
tioned by name until line 92. primus ε first. According to tradi-
tion, Antenor had already founded Patavium (Padua) in Cisalpine
Gaul, which was not included in Italy until 4⁶2 B.C., but the fact
is unimportant, and had nothing to do with the Roman race. ⁸

pression (Italiam) is followed by the more special (Lavinia litora),
the sense being tlte Lavinian shores of Italy. The region about
