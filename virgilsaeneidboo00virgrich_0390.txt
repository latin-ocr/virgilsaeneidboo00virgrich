merui is vivid for meruissem. With manu supply mea; cf. manu

. (The storm-simile in 416 ff. is carefully elaborated. It opens (416)
with impressive spondees, which are carried over into 417 (conj‘lz'qunc),
and then resnmed in 418 (after the first foot). The intervening dactyls
are aooompanied by polysyndeton (-que. -qew, ec), and marked aliitera-
tion (Eois Eurus equis). In the words following —strz'dmzt silvae
saevitque tridenti spumeus —— we have a striking ease of onomatopoeia,
depicting the straining of the forest trees and the surge and roar of
the sea.

As to other features, note the pathos in the repetition of Iumina
406. The spondeos of 410 open a tale of disaster3 the daotyls of 421
describe the sudden onset of the foe. Alliteration is employed in 402,
403, 400, 411, 414, 425 (double), 420 (double), 4:⁷33 (double), and 4:34,
while in 423 alliteration ancl assonance produce a striking vei-bal effect,
in keeping with the thought.)
