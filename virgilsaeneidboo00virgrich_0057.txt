adorned with sculptures. To such artistic embellishments
we have a reference in the Sixth Acncc'd, where Virgil dwells
at length upon the sculptured soenes 011 1116 doors 01
Apollo’s temple at Cumae, and in the First Book, where he
describes the sculptures 01 Juno’s temple in Carthage.
Similar references are found in the Eighth Acncicl and in
the Geowyics.

A vast number of noble productions 01 Greek art were
secured by Augustus to adorn his public buildings. All the
great masters of earlier days were represented, and contem-
porary artists were also employed. One 01 1116 latter was
Arcesilaus, who made a statue 01 Venus 101 1116 10111111 01

bare. 111 1116 Diana 01 Versailles2 the drapery is actually

The passage in Acncz'd, V. 817 ff„ where Neptune, attended
by his varied train, glides over the stormy seas and quiets
them, and that in the same book (240 ff), where Cloanthus
is heard by the choir 01 1116 Nereids and 01 Phorcys, by
Panopea and Portunus, remind us 01 a famous work 01
Scopas, which, about 30 Β.0., was taken from Bithynia and
set up in the temple 01 Neptune in Rome. This work
