FIG. 35. GANYMEDE AND THE
EAGLE.

(This paragraph, being expository, is comparatively free from artis-
tic refinements. Note, however, the anaphora (hic . . . hic . . . hoc
in 16 ancl 17, combined with the strong diaeresis after the second foot
in 17. Alliterations are rare, but see 18 (tum tenelle), 26 (manet . . .
smerde), and 31 (lonae Latio). The three slow spondees at the begin-
ning of 32, combined with the open a sounds of the line, are pictur-
esque‚ and the complete sentence in 33, sum marizing the main theme
of the poem, makes a powerful and effective close.)
