Rome be carried to a foreign land? In Livy¹ (a contem-
porary of Virgil), we may still read the fervid speech of
Camillus, in which the patriot shows how no true Roman
could entertain the idea of removing from Rome to Veii
after the destruction of the city by the Gauls.

In the case of Aeneas, therefore, Virgil's first aim must
have been to secure him against the reproach of weakness,
cowardice, and disloyalty. He had to arouse sympathy for
the fallen, and rob the Greeks of the glory which attends
success. And yet the story of Troy's fall was familiar from
tradition, and it would have been unwise, if not impossible,
to depart seriously from the well-known narrative. Thus
it is that early in the epic the poet shows not only that it
was through no lack of valor that Troy fell, but also that
the abandonment of the city was a duty imposed by fate
on the hero, who was to be the saviour of his kindred, his
countrymen, and his country’s gods. Hence that triumph
of poetic art, the brilliant narrative of the Second Book,
one of the most moving stories in the literature of the
world.

33. It has often been pointed out that the personality
of Aeneas, whether satisfactory or not, is essentially an
Traditions original creation of Virgil's. In the Homeric
of Aeneas. poems, though playing an honorable part, he
yet enjoys no special distinction, and, outside of Homer,
such legends as clung to him were exceedingly vague
and involved no striking features. He was, however, the
mo'st suitable person to choose as the mythical hero of
an epic on Rome, for he not only figured in both Trojan
and Italian traditions, but he was the reputed ancestor of
