216 Noms

meus Aeneas (231), and identified with Venus (250, ηοε, tua pro·
yenies). No followers of Antenor are mentioned, but the fate of
Aeneas involves the Trojan people (232). To Antenor no assurances
were given, but to Aeneas the most solemn promises. Antenor escaped
from his foes (242), and in safety (metm, 243) went to a more inaccessi-
ble and inhospitable country than Aeneas ainis at (243-6), yet founded
a city (247), and is now settled in peace (249). Aeneas and the
Trojans have suffered terrible disasters (232), are still pursued by
misfortune (240), have lost their ships (251), are kept far from the
promised land of Italy (252), and are even, it would seem, barred from
the whole world (233). Besides asyndeton (240, 249 (mmo), 250),
and anaphora (231-2, 23445, 236) note the effective alliteration in 245

(m), 246 (p), and 249 (m.)
