the Aphrodite cult was strong, there were temples asso
ciated with Aeneas. All this indicates a close connection
between Aeneas and Venus, summed up in the current be-
lief that Aeneas was the son of the goddess. γ

As to the founding of Rome, there was a great variety
of traditions. One myth made Romus, a son of Ulysses,
its founder. Dionysius, however, cites several authorities
in support of the tale that Aeneas founded Rome. This
story received special emphasis at the time of the war be-
tween Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, and Rome,l because Pyrrhus
claimed to be a descendant of Achilles, and the Romans, as
descendants of Aeneas, were naturally hereditary enemies.
At the end of the First Punic VVar, the Acharnanians applied
toRome for aid against the Aetolians, on the ground that
their ancestors had not joined in the war against Troy.
Rome, therefore, was believed to have a Trojan origin.

As Rome developed a literature, the poets took up the
matter, and Naevius traced the quarrel of Rome and Carthage
back to Aeneas and Dido. Ennius made Romulus the son
of Ilia and grandson of Aeneas, but it was soon discovered
that this did not allow enough time to elapse between Aeneas “
and Romulus. Δ According toa constant tradition, Rome had
had but seven kings before 509 Bc, when her first con-
suls were appointed, and reckoning one king to a generation
of thirty-five years, it was easy to reach the date 754 B.C.
for the founding of the city. But as Troy, according to
Greek chronology, had fallen some three centuries earlier,
it was necessary to fill in the intervening time between
Aeneas and Romulus. Hence Aeneas was made to found
not Rome itself but Lavinium, and was followed by a line
of Alban kings, leading up to Romulus, the actual founder

of Rome.
