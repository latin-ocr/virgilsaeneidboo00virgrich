645. manu: by my hand, not by suicide, but by provoking the
foe, as Priam had done. miserebitur: Le. the cruel act of the
enemy will, in his eyes, be one of inercy.

646. facilis iactura sepulchri: liqlzt is the loss of burial. This
expression of absolute despair is, of course, utterly at variance with
Roman sentiment.

647. invisus divis: explained by ex quo . . . [qni. annos de-
moror: I stay tlze years (in their flight), a very poetic expression.

648. ex quo: ever since. divum pater atque hominum rex:
cf. I. 65 With note.

649. fulminis adflavit ventis: breatlzed upon me with the winds
of his holt. Anchises was blasted by a lightning bolt, because he
had boasted of the love of Venus.

a very expressive phrase. Fate presses heavily enough even aside
from him.

654. incepto et sedibus haeret in isdem: abz'des in his pur-
pose ancl lais place. Such a combination of abstract and concrete
ideas is not uncommon in Virgil. In English, it is used mainly
with comic effect.
