INTRODUCTION xxvii

16. In Suetonius and Servius only two examples are cited
of passages omitted by the original editors. One is the
The mooe, prooemium of four lines, the personal introduc-
mium to Ι 11011 10 1110 Aeneid. This is certainly out of keep-
the ‘qene'd‘ ing with epic tone, drawing the attention as it
does to the poet rather than to his lofty theme, though not

The passage was apparently known to others, and was
possibly published later by some one who regretted its omis-
sion. Indeed, the very fact of its omission from the first
complete edition would bring it into notice, much as rejected
poems of modern writerstare not infrequently published by
their biographers and reviewers.
