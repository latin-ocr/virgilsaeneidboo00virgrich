he intended to spend the next three years in putting the
finishing touches to his epic. At Athens, however, nieeting
Hisjourney Augustus on his honieward journey from the
t0 ωηερε, East, he was induced to return with the emperor
ἓξὲξ and to Italy. A sever, contracted at Megara, grew

death at Brundisium, a few'days after landing, in the fifty-
first year of his age.
15. Before leaving Italy, Virgil had made his friends,
L. Varius and Plotius Tucca, his residuary legatees and liter-
, ary executors, directing them to publish nothing
{sstliiffilions which had not already been edited by 111111.1 This
to his request had special reference to the Aenez‘d, which
executors. he had begged Varius to burn in the event of
his death.2 So anxious was he to have this done that in
in his last hours he vainly called for his manuscript, so as to
destroy it with his own hands. It is pathetio to think of
the dying poet thus keenly sensitive to imperfections in his
work, and it cannot but increase our admiration for his
genius to learn that nothing satisfied him short of absolute
perfection. We are told that Varius had refused to give
his promise to destroy the poem. Be that as it may, Augus-
tus issued orders to have it published, directing the executors
to edit it, and presel-ibing that while they were at liberty to
remove super-fluities, yet they were to make no additions.³
The corrections made were very slight.‘¹
