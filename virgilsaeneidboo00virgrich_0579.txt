492. tollere vocem exiguam: raised α cry, but faintly. They
are unsubstantial shades, and the war-cry they raise is but the
faint echo of their former voices, ef. Hamlet (Aet Ι. Se. 1):

“ The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.'’

exiyuam is explained by the next words.
493. frustratur hiantis : malces- moclrery' ostheir yapiny mouths.

(Panic and flight are suggested by the accelerated rhythm of 489,
with its lengthy words. The effect is continued by alliteration in 490
(videre virum) and the repeated t sounds in 401. In the elosing words,
the prominent α sounds — clamor frustratur hiantis —strongly empha-
size the thought.)
