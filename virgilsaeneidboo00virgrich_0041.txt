in certain passages Virgil has given him too strong a resem-

more like Virgil himself. But Homer was the only model
worthy of Virgil, and we, realizing the solidarity of Classical
literature and the sense of continuity running through it all,
are sometimes *surprised to find how original and indepen-

same type. The world of the Augustan age was not the
same world as in the old Homeric days, and we have

of culture and art, of wealth and imperial power, as the
earlier is the product of an age of artlessness,-simplicity,

poetic chronicle of historical incidents from the earliest days of the city
to the poet’s own time. The work was regarded with veneration by all
Romans, and the Aeneia is saturated with its influence. Naevius, in his
epic, had handled the mythical history of both Rome and Carthage‚ and
thus provided Virgil with some of the material used in the first four books.

The tragedies of Pacuvius (219—129 Rc.) and Accius (170 to about 90
ac.) had also 110 little influence on Virgil.
